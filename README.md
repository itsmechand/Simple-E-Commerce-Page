# E-Commerce Project

## Overview
This is a simple e-commerce web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates user registration, login, logout, product browsing, and profile management, all on the client side using browser storage.

## Features
- **User Registration:** Users can register with a username, mobile number, and password. Data is stored in `localStorage`.
- **User Login:** Registered users can log in. Credentials are validated against stored data.
- **Product Page:** Displays a list of products with filtering options.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for page structure
- **CSS3** for styling
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for interactivity and logic
- **localStorage** for client-side data persistence

## Use of DOM and BOM
- **DOM (Document Object Model):**
  - Manipulates HTML elements dynamically (e.g., showing/hiding forms, updating product lists, displaying user info).
  - Handles user events (form submissions, button clicks, etc.).
- **BOM (Browser Object Model):**
  - Uses `window.location` for page navigation and redirects.
  - Uses `localStorage` (part of the BOM) for storing user and session data.

No server or backend is required; everything runs in the browser.

## Notes
- This project is for educational/demo purposes and does not implement real authentication or secure storage.
- All data is stored in the browser and will be lost if localStorage is cleared.
